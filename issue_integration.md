# Integrate MCP Servers

Integrate all MCP servers:

- [ ] Connect Agent MCP to other MCP servers
- [ ] Implement configuration loading for external MCP servers
- [ ] Handle MCP server logging with proper prefixing
- [ ] Implement agent query response handling

This will connect all the components of the system together.

Depends on #3, #4, #5, #6, and #7

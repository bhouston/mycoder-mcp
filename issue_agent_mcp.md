# Implement Agent MCP Server

Implement the Agent MCP server:

- [ ] Create proper package.json for mcp-server-agent
- [ ] Implement Agent MCP server based on existing code
- [ ] Implement agent tools (agentStart, agentMessage, agentDone, agentQuery)
- [ ] Add tests for Agent MCP server

This is the most important MCP server as it runs the local agent using the Claude LLM.

Depends on #1 (Project Setup)

# Refactor Text Editor MCP Server

Refactor the existing Text Editor MCP server:

- [ ] Update package.json to work in the monorepo
- [ ] Move lint rules, prettier settings, and test settings to the top level
- [ ] Ensure the package builds and tests pass

This package will be used as a pattern for the other MCP server packages.

Depends on #1 (Project Setup)

# Create CLI Package

Create the CLI package structure:

- [ ] Create packages/cli directory
- [ ] Set up package.json for CLI package
- [ ] Set up configuration loading with C12
- [ ] Create basic CLI structure with Citty

This will be the main entry point for the MyCoder-MCP tool.

Depends on #1 (Project Setup)

# Implement Shell Command MCP Server

Implement the Shell Command MCP server:

- [ ] Create proper package.json for mcp-server-shell
- [ ] Implement Shell MCP server based on existing code
- [ ] Implement shell tools (shellStart, shellMessage, listShells)
- [ ] Add tests for Shell MCP server

This tool allows the agent to run shell commands in both sync and async modes.

Depends on #1 (Project Setup)

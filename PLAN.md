# MyCoder-MCP Development Plan

## Overview

MyCoder-MCP is a Model Context Protocol (MCP) host that runs on the command line. It provides a CLI that can operate in two modes:
1. Interactive mode - Ask the user what they'd like to do
2. File execution mode - Execute a file containing the user's wishes

The system uses MCP servers/services for its tools, both external services configured in the configuration file and built-in local services.

## Development Phases

### Phase 1: Project Setup
- [ ] [#1: Project Setup](https://github.com/bhouston/mycoder-mcp/issues/1) - Set up root package.json with pnpm workspace configuration and shared configurations
- [ ] [#2: Create CLI Package](https://github.com/bhouston/mycoder-mcp/issues/2) - Create CLI package structure and set up configuration loading with C12

### Phase 2: Core MCP Implementation
- [ ] [#3: Implement Agent MCP Server](https://github.com/bhouston/mycoder-mcp/issues/3) - Implement Agent MCP server
- [ ] [#4: Refactor Text Editor MCP Server](https://github.com/bhouston/mycoder-mcp/issues/4) - Complete Text Editor MCP server (refactor existing code)
- [ ] [#5: Implement Shell Command MCP Server](https://github.com/bhouston/mycoder-mcp/issues/5) - Complete Shell Command MCP server (refactor existing code)
- [ ] [#6: Implement Fetch MCP Server](https://github.com/bhouston/mycoder-mcp/issues/6) - Complete Fetch MCP server (refactor existing code)

### Phase 3: CLI Implementation
- [ ] [#7: Implement CLI Commands](https://github.com/bhouston/mycoder-mcp/issues/7) - Implement CLI commands including interactive mode and file execution mode

### Phase 4: Integration
- [ ] [#8: Integrate MCP Servers](https://github.com/bhouston/mycoder-mcp/issues/8) - Connect all MCP servers and handle configuration and logging

### Phase 5: Testing and Documentation
- [ ] [#9: Testing and Documentation](https://github.com/bhouston/mycoder-mcp/issues/9) - Add comprehensive testing and documentation

## Implementation Details

### Package Structure
```
/
├── packages/
│   ├── cli/                    # Main CLI package
│   ├── mcp-server-agent/       # Agent MCP server
│   ├── mcp-server-text-editor/ # Text editor MCP server
│   ├── mcp-server-shell/       # Shell command MCP server
│   └── mcp-server-fetch/       # Fetch MCP server
└── ...
```

### Configuration
The CLI will use C12 to load configuration from:
- Default configuration
- `mycoder.config.js` file
- Environment variables
- Command line arguments

### MCP Servers
Each MCP server will follow the pattern established in the text editor MCP server, with appropriate modifications for the specific functionality.

### CLI Commands
- `mycoder` - Default command that expects a string of the user's wishes
- `mycoder -f <filename>` - Execute a file containing the user's wishes
- `mycoder interactive` or `mycoder i` - Enter interactive mode

## Implementation Plan

We'll implement this project incrementally, ensuring that the project builds and runs correctly at each stage. We'll create GitHub issues for each task and implement them one by one.

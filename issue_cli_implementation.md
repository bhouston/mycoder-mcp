# Implement CLI Commands

Implement the CLI commands:

- [ ] Implement default command that expects a string of the user's wishes
- [ ] Implement file execution mode with -f flag
- [ ] Implement interactive mode with 'interactive' or 'i' command
- [ ] Connect CLI to Agent MCP

This will provide the main user interface for MyCoder-MCP.

Depends on #2 (Create CLI Package) and #3 (Implement Agent MCP Server)
